1) Code should ask the user for input to run in Random or Manual mode. Next, regardless
of the mode the user entered the code ask the user for the number of rows and columns of the
normal form. Your code should be able to handle sizes of 1x1 to 9x9 without any display issues. 

2) If the random mode is selected the application will display the strategy spaces and payoffs of
players 1 and 2. Note in random mode the random payoffs are integers that range from -99 to 99.

3) The application will display the normal form of the game. Make sure your code can handle
normal forms of size 1x1 to 9x9 without alignment issues. player1 strategies are
dynamically name A1, A2 ... and for player2 B1, B2 ...

4) Display the Pure Nash Equilibrium by replacing the numerical value of the best response by
an ‘H’ in the normal form. Also output the Pure Nash Equilibrium(s). If there is no Pure Nash
Equilibrium still output the normal form with replacing the numerical value of the best
response by an ‘H’ and state there are no Pure Nash Equilibrium.

5) Create random beliefs then calculate the Expected Payoffs and Best Response(s) for players 1
and 2. Pay attention to the formatting and notation of your output.

6) Calculate the Expected Payoffs for players 1 and 2 with the actual mix that uses the random
generated beliefs in. Pay attention to the formatting and notation of your output.

7) In random mode if the normal form is 2x2 and there is no Pure Nash Equilibrium then calculate
the indifference probabilities of players 1 and 2

8) In manual mode get user input for the rows, columns and payoffs. Then display the Normal
form and the Pure Nash Equilibrium information.

9) If the Normal Form is 2x2 and the game does not have a Pure Nash Equilibrium then
calculate players 1 and 2 Indifferent Mix Probabilities.
